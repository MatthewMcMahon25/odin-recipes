# odin-recipes

This project is about practicing the HTML skills I have learned through The Odin project

The project will feature a basic recipe website.

It will consist of a main index page with a few other recipes included.

The project will demonstrate my ability to code in HTML, with the capacity for further CSS skills to be integrated at a later date.
